    # and the entire cas-bacnet-stack has many dependencies, including unit testing frameworks. 
    # so we can't just put the entire cas-bacnet-stack folder into the lib folder. We need to 
    # move the files that are needed into lib folder for the build.

# After the project builds I could not find the .pioenvs in the docker image. 
# this folder does exist on my local computer during testing just not in the 
# docker image. The artifacts are not required because this is just to ensure 
# that changes can be built without error. There is no unit tests, or production 
# tests happening on this binary. 
# Still strange that I could not get the binary.
